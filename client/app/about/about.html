  <h1>Who We Are</h1>
  <p class="mission">The Mower County Humane Society is a 100% volunteer-operated animal shelter located in Austin, Minnesota
  We have a shelter built at 101 22nd Street SE in Austin. This is a new location that might not yet appear on Google
  maps or on GPS devices. However it's easy to get to our location by simply following Oakland Avenue to the east as far as you can go,
  and you can't miss our shelter. Our shelter phone number is 507-437-9262. It is our goal to provide care and shelter
  for homeless pets, adopt them into responsible homes, and promote responsible pet ownership, including spaying and neutering of
  companion animals.</p>
